This is a new [**React Native**] project

# Getting Started

>**Note**: This is news listing app.

## Step 1: Open the app, you will see news listing

Here I have used 4 free apis to fetch the random news.

Every time the url will be different so the results will be different.

## Step 2: Pull to refresh

When you pull the list it will refreshed with new url and new listing.

## Step 3: Search

On the search method I have used the simple logic to search within the list. 

After press the cross icon right side of the search box the previous list will be rendered.

## Step 4: Details screen

On tap a news item you will be redirected to details screen with the preloaded data.

## Step 5: Edit info

In the details screen on tap the edit info the description will be rendered in a multiline textinput you can edit and submit it.

>**Note**: But the edit will only reflect in local, it will be stored in redux state. Because the apis is only for listing.

## Extra points :tada:

Here is some extra points to describe the app.

### These are:

- Class based codebase.
- Axios for api calling using interceptor.
- API error handling.
- Used react navigation to redirect screen.
- Used redux to handle state management
- for filter I have used the search box as of now.
- Pull to refresh
- Make a dynamic description edit box
- Component based.
